# firefox-hardened

[![GitHub Release](../../actions/workflows/github-release.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/github-release.yml)

A `user.js` configuration file for Mozilla Firefox designed to harden browser settings and make it more secure.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Get Started

There are two possible installation variants.

### Single Profile Installation

Copy the [`user.js`](../../releases/latest/download/user.js) file to the Firefox installation directory. The file should be located at:

| OS                         | Path                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows                    | `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<GOOGLE_CITYHASH>.your_profile_name\user.js`                                                                       |
| Linux                      | `~/.mozilla/firefox/<GOOGLE_CITYHASH>.your_profile_name/user.js`                                                                                       |
| OS X                       | `~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/<GOOGLE_CITYHASH>.your_profile_name`                                                                   |
| Android                    | `/data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/<GOOGLE_CITYHASH>.your_profile_name`                                                                     |
| Sailfish OS + Alien Dalvik | `/opt/alien/data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/<GOOGLE_CITYHASH>.your_profile_name`                                                           |
| Windows (portable)         | `[firefox directory]\Data\profile\`                                                                                                                    |

With this installation method, if any of `user.js` settings is changed through [`about:config`](http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config) or Firefox preferences dialogs, they will be reset to the `user.js` defined values after restarting Firefox. This makes sure they're always back to secure defaults when starting the browser. However this prevents persistently changing settings you don't consider appropriate. Either edit `user.js` directly, or use the system-wide installation method described below.

### System-wide Installation

Download one of the following files:

- [`systemwide_user.js`](../../releases/latest/download/systemwide_user.js): It will be used as a default value for all Firefox Profiles where particular preferences are not explicitly set. It can be changed in `about:config` and is kept across browser sessions.
- [`locked_user.js`](../../releases/latest/download/locked_user.js): It will be used as a default value for all Firefox Profiles where particular preferences are not explicitly set. It cannot be changed in `user.js` or Firefox's `about:config` and is kept across browser sessions. 
- [`debian_locked.js`](../../releases/latest/download/debian_locked.js): Debian specific. Users are not able to override preferences.

Copy the downloaded file to the Firefox installation directory. The file should be located at:

| OS                        | Path                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows                   | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\mozilla.cfg`                         |
| Linux                     | `/etc/firefox/syspref.js`, for older versions: `/etc/firefox/firefox.js`     |
| Linux (Debian)            | `/etc/firefox-esr/firefox-esr.js`                                            |
| Linux (Gentoo, Archlinux) | `/usr/lib/firefox/mozilla.cfg`, might also be `/usr/lib32/` or `/usr/lib64/` |
| OS X                      | `/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/Resources/mozilla.cfg`                   |

#### Additional installation steps for Windows / OS X / Gentoo / Archlinux

Create a `local-settings.js` in the Firefox installation directory, with the following contents:

```
pref("general.config.obscure_value", 0);
pref("general.config.filename", "mozilla.cfg");
```

This file should be located at:

| OS                        | Path                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows                   | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\pref\`                         |
| OS X                      | `/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/Resources/defaults/pref`                    |
| Linux (Gentoo, Archlinux) | `/usr/lib/firefox/defaults/pref/`, might also be `/usr/lib32/` or `/usr/lib64/` |

If `mozilla.cfg` still fails to load, you must add a blank comment to the top of `mozilla.cfg` like so:
```
//
```
